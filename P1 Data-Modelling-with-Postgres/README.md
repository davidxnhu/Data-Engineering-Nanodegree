## Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.


In this project, we apply Data Modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. A startup wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, they are collecting data in json format and the analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

## Project Description

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Song dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.  Here is an example of song file:

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

## Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. Here is an example of log file:

## Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.

This database is extremely useful in the context of the startup, Sparkify, to analyze the user behaviours and improve the user experiences when they use the app.

For example, it could provide rankings e.g. popular songs, popular artists, etc.

In addition, the user behaviour could be identified, i.e. how much they will listen on each day, if they like to hear more on weekdays or weekends, how many would like to become a paid user, etc.

Therefore, the database provides a foundation for further data analysis processes.

## State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.

The star scheme is used for this database. It consists of one fact table (songplays) and references to four dimention tables (users, songs, artists, time).

**songplays**  - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
* songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

**users** - users in the app
* user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

**songs** - songs in music database
* song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

**artists** - artists in music database
* artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
* start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday


ETL pipeline starts from reading from song and log dataset which include the details of the user behaviours and the songs that the user could listen to, and loads the data into tables. The fact table (songplays) provides the metric of the business process (here the user activity in the app). Further analysis could be proceeded with queries in the database.

## Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.

In test.ipynb, after checking if the data is loaded into the table, some example queries are executed.

For example, it is found that users listen to the music mostly on Wednesdays, and least on weekends (Saturday and Sunday); it is found that both Clp and Casual have 2 songs that are included in the database, that are most among all artists; it is also found that paid users listen to more songs than free users, etc.

So perhaps the company could promote more on using the app on weekdays to make more paid users :) 

## NOTE: You will not be able to run ```test.ipynb```, ```etl.ipynb```, or ```etl.py``` until you have run ```create_tables.py``` at least once to create the sparkifydb database, which these other files connect to. 

**Remember to run "etl.py" since after running ```create_tables.py``` all tables are empty.** , in details they could be executed by 

```
python create_tables.py 
python etl.py 
```
